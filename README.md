**Here i am going to give the description about the topics which i have learn from the given video:-**
...

1. The first thing i learn is how we can create a DOS command Link on our desktop by using shortcuts.
2. Then i create a folder name as (work) in my document folder.
3. Then i add a text file in that folder and named it with my PC name, and copy the path of that file.
4. After that, i add some information in that text file, so that we can enlarge the size of the file.
5. In command line, i use some commands like dir, ipconfig, systeminfo and more.
